**If you too, when asked what's your favourite book is, you forget every book you ever read. This project might be for
you!**
With this application, when asked this question, you will have access to the entirety of all the books you registered,
with the review you could have wrote for them... But that's only the start! See <a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a>

## Stack used

- Laravel v10.x

  Build or rebuild services

### Use Docker

````

Access the terminal of the php service

````

Initialize the values of the database

#### Laravel App

## Without Docker
The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. You should ensure that your web server has the following minimum PHP version and extensions:

    PHP >= 8.1
    Ctype PHP Extension
    cURL PHP Extension
    DOM PHP Extension
    Fileinfo PHP Extension
    Filter PHP Extension

To install dependencies:
````bash
composer install
````

````bash
npm install
````

**Don't forget to set the .env with your settings. You can copy the .env.example.**

Initialize the values of the database
````bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
````

To run the laravel server & to build Tailwind automatically:
````bash
php artisan serve
npm run dev
````

# Testing
## Write test
Laravel application's use PHPUnit for testing purposes. If you want to know more about it the Laravel
documentation explain the commands: https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/testing

Otherwise, I would also recommend this video that explained everything very well (in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MJmU-wRwpI

## Execute test
To test without coverage
```bash
php artisan test
```

To test with coverage:
```bash
php artisan test --coverage
```
